# Enclosure LED Utilities

Current version is 1.1.0.

Enclosure LED Utilities is a Linux project for monitoring and controlling storage device LEDs
on platforms. It enables visual identification and status indication (locate, fault, rebuild, etc.) for drives in enclosures and backplanes.

For more details and list of supported LED control protocols, refer to `ledmon(8)` man page.

The project provides following tools:
- **`ledmon`** — a daemon that monitors md RAID array and automatically updates drive LEDs to reflect array status.
- **`ledctl`** — a command-line tool for manually setting LED states on specific storage devices.
- **`libled`** — a shared library that exposes LED control functionality for integration into
  third-party applications.
